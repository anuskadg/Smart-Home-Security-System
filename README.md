# Smart-Home-Security-System
This project is a motion-activated smart home security system built using Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and a custom-trained TensorFlow Lite model. It features facial recognition to allow access only to authorized individuals, and triggers a buzzer alert for any unauthorized entries. A PIR sensor is used to detect motion, while a camera module captures real-time video footage.
